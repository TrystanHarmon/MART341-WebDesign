            <p>Changing a tire is a necessary skill for every driver. Whether you're on the road or in your driveway, knowing how to change a tire can save you time and money. Follow our step-by-step guide below to learn how:</p>
            <ol>

                <li>Loosen the lug nuts on the flat tire, but do not remove them completely.</li>
                <li>Position the jack under the vehicle's frame near the flat tire and raise the vehicle until the flat tire is off the ground.</li>
                <li>Remove the lug nuts and then the flat tire.</li>
                <li>Mount the spare tire onto the wheel studs and tighten the lug nuts by hand.</li>
                <li>Lower the vehicle to the ground using the jack and then tighten the lug nuts securely with the lug wrench.</li>
                <li>Double-check all lug nuts to ensure they are tightened properly.</li>
