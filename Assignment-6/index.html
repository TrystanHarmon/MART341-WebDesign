            <ol>
                <!-- List of instructions -->
                <li> Preheat oven to 375F (190C) and whisk together 1 Tablespoon melted butter and 1 ½ teaspoons flour. Use a pastry brush to lightly but thoroughly grease every cavity of your madeleine pan. Set aside.</li>
                <li> In a small heatproof bowl, melt remaining 10 Tablespoons of butter. Set aside to cool.</li>
                <li> In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugars, vanilla extract, and salt. Whisk vigorously until thoroughly combined (about 30 seconds).</li>
                <li> Sift flour into the egg mixture, about 1/3 of the flour at a time, gently stirring into egg mixture after each addition</li>
                <li> Drizzle cooled melted butter around the edge of the batter and add zest, if using. Gently fold into batter using a spatula until ingredients are thoroughly combined (but do not over-mix).</li>
                <li> Drop batter by heaping Tablespoon into prepared pan.</li>
                <li> Transfer to center rack of 375F (190C) preheated oven and bake for 9 minutes or madeleines are light golden brown and spring back when lightly touched. Remove to a cooling rack to cool immediately.</li>
                <li> If your madeleine pan did not hold all of the batter, allow the pan to cool before re-brushing with butter/flour mixture and refilling with batter and baking your next batch.</li>
                <li> If desired, sprinkle madeleines with additional powdered sugar or dip in melted chocolate before serving.</li>
            </ol>
