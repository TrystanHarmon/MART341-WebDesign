this is assignment 4 of WebDesign

1. Explain how web browsers function
The main function of a browser is to present the web resource you choose, by requesting it from the server and displaying it in the browser window. The resource is usually an HTML document, but may also be a PDF, image, or some other type of content.
2. Define and describe DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing developers to manipulate the content, structure, and style of a webpage dynamically.
The DOM provides a way for scripts to access and update the content of a webpage, allowing for interactive and dynamic web applications. By using DOM methods and properties, developers can add, remove, or modify elements on a webpage, change styles, handle events, and more.
3. What is the difference between HTML XML and XHTML?
HTML is primarily used to develop an application's UI. It renders the text, images, buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown boxes seen on a website or application. In contrast, the primary purpose of XML is the exchange and transfer of data. It encodes data in a format readable by both machines and humans.
4. What are the 4 elements your HTML pages need?
the 4 elements our html pages need are the html, head, title, and body
5. What is the index.html page for? Where does it go?
The index is the root or starting point of your website. This naming policy is crucial for web development as it ensures website builders have uniform experiences with the servers they work on. This index. HTML has to be placed in a specific location on the server.
6. Review: What are some of the best naming practices?
Keep file names short but meaningful.
Include any unique identifiers, e.g. case number, or project title. Be consistent. Indicate the version number where appropriate. Ensure the purpose of the document is quickly and easily identifiable.
